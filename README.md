# Hi, I'm Emily 👋🏻
In early 2024, I left a 10 year career in the NHS to pursue a new adventure in iOS app development. 
I am a self-taught junior iOS developer with the enthusiasm to learn and understand more about all things Swift.

📫 Please feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emily-blackford-479257bb/).

# My apps 📱
## 👶🏻 BabyNamer
My very first project, this iOS app allows users to find a name for their new baby collaboratively with their partner/friends/family. The app contains a list of 10,000 of the most popular boy, girl and unisex names from the UK, US and Australia.

Starting out with my first app was always going to be a challenging experience and I learnt a lot along the way including a lot of very obscure names that exist out there.

Technologies I used included SwiftUI and SwiftData. 
### 🙇🏼‍♀️ What I learnt: 
- Working with SwiftData
- Organising Navigation to give a seamless journey through the app
- Sorting through a large amount of names with a weighted bias to ensure more common names are more likely to appear
- Streamlining filtering of data to reduce clunky UI transitions in a card stack
- Implementing analytics to understand why app was crashing when swiping too enthusiastically

## 👦🏼 Babble Counter
Sticking with the theme of children, my second app focuses on tracking young children's speech development (up to the age of 5 years).

With a decent amount of UI experience under my belt, designing the UI and Navigation structure of this app felt a little easier. I tried using a different technology with Firebase to store the user's children and word lists to compare its implementation to SwiftData that I used previously.

Technologies used for this app included Firebase Firestore, SwiftUI, and a MVVM architecture.
### 🙇🏼‍♀️ What I learnt:
- Creating custom UI elements to replace default SwiftUI elements and implement these app-wide
- Using Repositories to handle communication between view models and Firestore database
- How to use a path-based navigation structure
- Using AppStorage to maintain app and user states

# 🌱 My learning journey
I have used resources from a variety of online sources to help with my iOS development journey. I started with learning the basics from tutorials and community sources like StackOverflow, CodingWithChris CWC+ and Hacking With Swift+. 
Creating apps has helped me to learn and understand about the full app development process: creating ideas, designing, wire framing, hiring a designer, development, signing up for the Apple Developer Program and submitting apps for review and approval. Also monitoring for crashes and analytics and making continued improvements and fixes.
I'm keen to understand and explore other technologies to help me develop more refined apps. I am now attending meetups and conferences to network and meet other developers for mentoring, collaborations and to develop my skills further.

# ⚡ Random fact
In 2020, during lockdown, I started a micro vegan baking business to 'give me something to do' after having my first baby. I learnt a lot about multitasking that year!
